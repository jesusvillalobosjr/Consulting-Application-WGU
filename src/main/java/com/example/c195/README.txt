Directions:
When starting up application log in with a proper username and password.
There will be 4 radio buttons, the current page being for customers, followed by 3 others dealing with appointments
one for all appointments, on for appointments by week, and one for appointments by month.
In the customer page you get directed to create a customer, select a customer to modify, and delete a customer.
In all 3 appointments pages you can get directed to create an appointment, select an appointment to modify, and delete
an appointment.
There is a reports button to look at reports based on contact, appointment by type, appointment by month, and
appointment by customer. A choice box will be present to select those choices for each of those reports pages.

Additional Report:
The additional report added was appointments by customer, this takes the static ObservableList of appointments for
each customer object and displays all appointments for the customer selected in the table view. This additional
report made sense as it may be important to see how many appointments a customer has.
